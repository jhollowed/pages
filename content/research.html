I am currently a member of the Jablonowski <a href='https://admg.engin.umich.edu/'>Atmospheric Dynamics Modeling Group</a> at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, MI. Most of my time is spent outfitting computational climate models with interesting idealized capabilities. See my <a href="talks.html">slide decks</a>, <a href="papers.html">publications</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jhollowed">GitHub repositories</a> for samples of recent work.

Our group works in close collaboration with Sandia National Laboratory scientists on the <a href="">CLDERA (CLimate impact: Determining Etiology thRough pAthways)</a> Grand Challenge, developing the ability to identify downstream impacts arising from temporary and geographically localized forcings in the climate. My primary focus on the team is documented in a <a href="./assets/docs/hollowed_prelim.pdf">set of notes</a> on a simplified physical parameterization for volcanic aerosol forcings of the stratosphere in the DOE <a href="https://e3sm.org/">E3SM (Exascale Energy Earth System Model)</a>. Our group also focuses on more general assessments of E3SM, including the development of advection-based tracer methods for quantifying the general circulation of the model's atmospheric component.

I was previously a student in computational cosmology at Argonne National Laboratory's <a href="http://press3.mcs.anl.gov/cpac/">CPAC</a> group. For samples of my work there, see my description of our method of post-processed <a href="./pub_pages/lightcone_notes_res.html">lightcone construction</a>, as well as our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06530">paper</a> detailing the creation of the <i>DC2</i> synthetic galaxy catalog for the <a href="http://lsst-desc.org">LSST DESC</a>.

<i> Figure: Color scale shows the density of atmospheric sulfate aerosols circulating about the North pole in the E3SM climate model. The aerosols are produced via a reaction of volcanic sulfur dioxide, which we inject near the position of Luzon, Phillippines via our custom idealized volcanic eruption model.
