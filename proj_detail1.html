Detailed below are several of my current and past scientific research endeavors, as well as general academic and recreational projects. Presentation slide decks can also be found for some of the research described here in my list of scientific <a href="./talks.html">talks</a>.

<strong>Research</strong>

Most of my work resides in theoretical and computational cosmology, working on both analysis and modeling tasks. <br><br>

We currently find ourselves in an exciting age, wherein we see petascale astronomical data releases on the horizon, thanks to extensive sky surveys like <a href="https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/">DES</a> and <a href="https://www.lsst.org/">LSST</a>. With these unprecedented data volumes, statistical uncertainties are falling to sub-percent levels, leaving our analyses dominated by systematics errors. Thus, the community is now tasked with producing very accurate models of astrophysical and cosmological systems. Working toward this goal, as it turns out, is great fun, and calls for supercomputers to run the largest and most detailed simulations of the universe's evolution to date. It is this that motivates my work showcased here, and inspires my daily musings.<br>

I am currently working on development of <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2805'>HACC</a> <small>(Hybrid/Hardware Accelerated Cosmology Code)</small> simulation components at <a href="http://press3.mcs.anl.gov/cpac/">CPAC</a>. Specifically, I have been involved in writing code to process simulation outputs and generate lightcone datasets. The technical details of my work can be found in <a href="lightcone_notes.html">an extensive set of notes</a> that have been written on the subject.<br>

I am also involved in the creation of synthetic galaxy catalogs for the <a href="http://lsst-desc.org/CS-SyntheticSky">LSST DESC</a>, designed to prepare analysis pipelines for LSST first-light. Previously, I have also worked on cluster cosmology projects, concentrating on velocity-dispersion-mass scaling relations, and using this as a metric by which to validate the above mentioned synthetic catalogs. See my <a href="./talks.html">talks from 2017 and 2016</a> to see a sample of this work, and read my <a href="dispersion_notes.html">unofficial paper</a> on the subject for full details. Additionally, all of my code products from everything I've worked on at CPAC  are maintained on <a href="https://github.com/jhollowed/cosmology">GitHub</a>.
