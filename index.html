  I am a postdoctoral researcher in climate science at the <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/physics">University of Michigan</a>, wroking with Professor Christiane Jablonowski. I completed my PhD in physics in January of 2025, during which I worked at <a href="https://www.sandia.gov/cldera/">Sandia National Laboratory</a> and was a fellow at the Michigan Institute for Computational Discovery and Engineering (<a href="https://micde.umich.edu/ph-d-in-scientific-computing/">MICDE</a>).
