  I am a graduate student researcher at <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/physics">University of Michigan</a> in Ann Arbor and fellow at the Michigan Institute for Computational Discovery and Engineering (<a href="https://micde.umich.edu/ph-d-in-scientific-computing/">MICDE</a>). I hold an bachelor's in Physics from <a href="https://csh.depaul.edu/academics/physics/about/Pages/default.aspx">DePaul University</a>, and did my undergraduate research at the Cosmological Physics and Advanced Computing Group (<a href="http://press3.mcs.anl.gov/cpac/">CPAC</a>) at Argonne National Laboratory near Ann Arbor, MI.

  <strong>Study Interests</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p style="margin-bottom:30px">
  – Computational physics, particularly as applied to problems in large-scale gravitation via <a href="http://press3.mcs.anl.gov/cpac/research/simulations/">cosmological simulations</a>.<br> 
  – Solving the inverse problem related to constraining cosmological parameters; investigating observational and astrophysical systematics. <br>
  – Python, C++, data visualization, high performance computing, and websites that don't use JS.<br>
  – Photography, videography, and open-source Adobe-alternative projects like <a href="https://www.darktable.org/">Darktable</a> and <a href="https://kdenlive.org/">Kdenlive</a><br>
    – Cycling, hiking and camping, playing music, and meditation
