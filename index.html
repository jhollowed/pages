  I am a graduate student researcher at <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/physics">University of Michigan's</a> Physics department and fellow at the Michigan Institute for Computational Discovery and Engineering (<a href="https://micde.umich.edu/ph-d-in-scientific-computing/">MICDE</a>). My current research in Climate Science is advised by Professor Christaine Jablonowski.
